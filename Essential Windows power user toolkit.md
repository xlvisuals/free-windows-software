# Essential Windows power user toolkit  
  
## Deployment & multi-boot

- **Ventoy:** The absolute king of bootable USB drives. Instead of flashing a single ISO to a thumb drive and wiping it every time, you install Ventoy to the drive *once*. From then on, you simply drag and drop your Windows ISOs, Linux distros, and WinPE recovery discs directly onto the drive like standard files. Ventoy automatically generates a boot menu at startup, letting you carry dozens of bootable environments on a single piece of hardware.
