## Security Advice

In recent years highly automated “software supply chain attacks” have increasingly common and effective. They work by compromising third–party libraries, developer tools, or dependencies that developers use to develop, package, or deploy their software. When the software is installed,the end-user receives the malware package bundled with the trusted software. We have also seen an increase in “sleepers”, where once tools that were useful become malicious.


**Examples:**


- [DarkSpectre Browser Extension (2026)](https://www.koi.ai/blog/darkspectre-unmasking-the-threat-actor-behind-7-8-million-infected-browsers): 8,8 million installations.

- [AnyDesk Production Breach (2024)](https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/following-the-anydesk-incident-customer-credentials-leaked-and-published-for-sale-on-the-dark-web): 170,000 customers impacted.

- [GlassWorm IDE Extension Attack (2025–2026)](https://www.veracode.com/blog/glassworm-vs-code-extension/): 35,800 confirmed installations.

- [SolarWinds "Orion" Hack (2020)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10148): 18,000 downloads, ~100 high-value targets breached.

- [Kaseya VSA Ransomware Attack (2021)](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2021/07/04/cisa-fbi-guidance-msps-and-their-customers-affected-kaseya-vsa-supply-chain-ransomware-attack): 1,500 businesses ransomed.


**Advise:**


- Treat **every app**, software and browser extension as **a potential backdoor**. Be very guarded and disciplined when installation software and verify the origin as well as that the package is free from malware using e.g. [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)

- Only install software that you are going to use and **uninstall software that is not in use**, for example uninstall after 30 days of no use.

- Unless it is a critical security patch for an actively exploited bug, **wait 48 hours** before installing a new software update or a new browser extension. In almost every case, the community or security researchers flagged the anomaly within the first 24 hours.
